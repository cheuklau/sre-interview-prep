Point the next node of pointer 1 to null, and the next node of pointer 2 to the head. Move pointer 1 and 2 down the linked list by 1 (i.e., pointer 1 goes to 2 and pointer 2 goes to temp). Set the next temp pointer as the node downstream of pointer 2. Repeat until temp node points to null at which point we set the head as pointing to the pointer 2 node. We return the pointer 2 node.

While making this copy, create a hashmap where the key is the original linked list node address and the value is the copied linked list node address. Make a pass through the copied linked list node and replace the arbitrary pointer with the address of the corresponding linked list node in the second linked list.
