    "Set pointer 1 to the head, set pointer 2 to the next node. Set a third pointer temp to the next node after that. Point the next node of pointer 1 to null, and the next node of pointer 2 to the head. Move pointer 1 and 2 down the linked list by 1 (i.e., pointer 1 goes to 2 and pointer 2 goes to temp). Set the next temp pointer as the node downstream of pointer 2. Repeat until temp node points to null at which point we set the head as pointing to the pointer 2 node. We return the pointer 2 node. This is O(n) in time and O(1) in space since we reversed it in place.\n",
