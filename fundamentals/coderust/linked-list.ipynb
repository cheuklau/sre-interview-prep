Point the next node of pointer 1 to null, and the next node of pointer 2 to the head. Move pointer 1 and 2 down the linked list by 1 (i.e., pointer 1 goes to 2 and pointer 2 goes to temp). Set the next temp pointer as the node downstream of pointer 2. Repeat until temp node points to null at which point we set the head as pointing to the pointer 2 node. We return the pointer 2 node.

    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Given head pointer to a linked list, sort the linked list in ascending order using merge sort and return the new head pointer of the sorted linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "N/A\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first half of the algorithm, we recursively split the linked list into two until we reach single length linked lists which are sorted by default. In the second half of the algorithm, we recombine the linked list in the same order as before but merge the linked lists such that they are sorted. This follows the same strategy as the previous problem. The time complexity is O(nlogn) and space complexity is O(logn) for the recursive call.\n",

    "### Optimal Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Same as initial thoughts."
