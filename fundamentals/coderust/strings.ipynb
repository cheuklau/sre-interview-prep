    "If we are allowed extra space, we could just iterate through the string, storing each word (based on space delimiter) and then iterate backwards through array appending to a string. We can also do this without extra space by first reversing the entire string in place then reverse each word in place. The time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You cannot reverse a string in place in Python because strings are immutable. For this problem, we will just represent the string as an array of chars.\n",
