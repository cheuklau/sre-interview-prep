We can also do this without extra space by first reversing the entire string in place then reverse each word in place. The time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(1).\n",

Each letter can either be the center of the palindrome in the case of an odd-numbered string, or the letter along with the next letter in the string are the center if the palindrome is an even-numbered string. Note that the latter can only be true if the two adjacent letters are the same. For each case, we can use two pointers to move forward and backwards at the same time, continuing as long as the pointers to the letters match. Once they no longer match or we reach the beginning or end of the string, we terminate the process for the current letter, and store the palindrome. The time complexity of this is O(n^2) since we have to visit each letter and for each letter we may have to visit every other node (e.g., if all the letters are the same).
