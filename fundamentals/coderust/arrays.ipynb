However, this brute force approach does not take into account the fact that the array is pre-sorted. We can instead perform a slight variation of the binary search where we first locate the low index and then locate the high index. To locate the low index, we perform a binary search except if mid element is greater than or equal to the key the we move the high index to mid - 1. Likewise if the mid element is less than the key then we move the low elemen to mid + 1. When low and high cross, then low index will be pointing to the first occurence of the key. For finding the high index, when the mid element is less than or equal to the key then we move the low index to mid + 1, and when the element at mid is greater than the key move high index to mid - 1. When low and high crosses then high will be pointing to the last index of key. The time complexity in this case is O(logn) since we are just doing binary search twice.
