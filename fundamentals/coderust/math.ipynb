    "The number of permutations is `n!` for a set of size `n`. Easiest to view algorithm with an example. Consider the set `{1, 2, 3, 4}` and `k=8`. The number of possible permutations for each of those numbers to be the first digit is `(n-1)!=3!=6`. Since we are looking for the kth permutation in order, we can think of blocks of 6 permutations assigned to `1, 2, 3` and `4`. Which of these blocks will `k=8` land in? The answer is `(k-1)//block=(8-1)//6=1` i.e., the block containing `2` which is now the first digit of the permutation. Our list now goes down to `{1, 3, 4}`. We also update `k=k-selected*block=8-1*6=2`. We now repeat with the new list and `k` until no numbers remain. The time and space complexity is O(n).\n",

    "The brute force approach is to just continually add by increments of the divisor until you pass the dividend then return the iteration count.

    "We start with a quotient of 1 and temp set equal to the divisor. We keep shifting quotient and temp to the left by one until temp is equal or greater than the dividend. If temp is equal to the dividend, then we return the quotient. Otherwise, we right shift quotient and temp by one, store the quotient and set dividend minus temp as the new dividend and repeat the previous recursively until temp equals to the dividend. At the end we sum up all of the final quotients. The time complexity is O(logn) and O(1) if implemented iteratively.\n",
