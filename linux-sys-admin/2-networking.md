## Chapter 14 - TCP/IP Networking

### TCP/IP and Its Relationship too the Internet

- TCP/IP is an open and non-proprietary protocol suite.
- Requests for Coomments (RFCs) standardize internet protocols.
- Relevant RFCs:
    * RFC791: Internet Protocol (IP)
        + Routes data from one machine to another.
    * RFC792: Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
        + Low level support for IP for debugging.
    * RFC826: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
        + Translates IP addresses to hardware addresses.
    * RFC768: User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
        + Unverified one-way data delivery.
    * RFC793: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
        + Reliable, full duplex, error-corrected conversations.
- TCP/IP layering model
    1. Application layer
        * ARP (goes to ARP)
        * SSH, FTP, HTTP (goes to TCP)
        * DNS, gaming (goes to UDP)
        * traceroute (goes to UDP or ICMP)
    2. Transport layer
        * TCP (goes to IP)
        * UDP (goes to IP)
    3. Network layer
        * IP (goes to ARP, device drivers)
        * ICMP (goes horizontally to IP)
    4. Link layer
        * ARP
        * Device drivers
    5. Physical layer
        * Optical fiber
        * Radio waves
- Data travels on a network in packets.
- Each packet has a header and a payload.
    * Header tells where packet came from and where it is going.
    * Payload is the data to be transferred.
- Primitive data unit is called:
    * A segment in the TCP layer.
    * A packet in the IP layer.
    * A frame in the link layer.
- Each protocol adds its own header to the packet.
    * This nesting is known as encapsulation.
    * On receiving machine, encapsulation is reversed.
- Link layer adds headers to packets and separates them so receiver can tell where one stops and another begins.
    * This process is known as framing.
- Maximum transfer unit (MTU) over ethernet is 1500 bytes.
- IP layer splits packets to conform to the MTU.
- TCP protocol does path MTU discovery automatically to find hop with the smallest MTU to determine how small packets must be sized to reach the destination.
- Use `ifconfig` to set an interface's MTU.

### Packet Addressing

- Several packet addressing schemes:
1. MAC addresses for hardware.
2. IPv4 and IPv6 network addresses for software.
3. Hostnames for use by people.
- IP addresses identify network interfaces, not machines!
- MAC addresses are 2-digit hex bytes e.g., `00:50:8D:9A:3B:DF`.
- IP addresses are universally unique and hardware independent.
- IP to hardware address done at the link layer.
- One or more hostnames can map too IP addresses using `/etc/hosts`, LDAP or DNS.
- Port is a 16-bit number that supplments an IP to specify a particular communication channel.
- Services are bound to certain ports in `/etc/services`.
- Address types includes unicast, multicast, broadcast, and anycast.

### IP Addressing: The Gory Details

- Internet addresses consist of a network and a host portion
    * Network identifies a logical network
    * Host poriton identifies a node on the network
- `127.0.0.1` is the localhost
- `ifconfig` sets an interface's IP address
- Internet address classes (1st byte):
    * Class A (1-127): early networks
    * Class B (128-191): large sites
    * Class C (192-223): easy to get
    * Class D (224-239): multi-cast
    * Class E (240-255): experimental
- Subnet masks define which portion of the address is for the network and which are for the hosts.
    * Example `255.255.0.0` results in N.N.H.H

### CIDR Notation

- In CIDR notation, network ends with `/XX` which is the number of bits in the network portion.
    * Example: `128.138.243.0/24` means `128.138.243` is the network.
- Consider `172.16.0.0/12`
    * The IP can be rewritten in binary as:
    ```
    1010 1100 - 0001 0000 - 0000 0000 - 0000 0000
    ```
    where `2^7+2^5+2^3+2^2=172, 2^4=16`.
    * The `/12` indicates the first 12 bits are masked for the network. Therefore the following is fixed for the network:
    ```
    1010 1100 - 0001
    ```
    * The remaining bits can represent the hosts. Therefore the starting host is:
    ```
    1010 1100 - 0001 0000 - 0000 0000 - 0000 0000
    ```
    The ending host is:
    ```
    1010 1100 - 0001 1111 - 1111 1111 - 1111 1111
    ```
    or in decimal terms: `127.16.0.0` to `127.31.255.255`.

### Private Address and Network Address Translation (NAT)

- Private addresses are used by site internally but not shown to internet
- Border router translates between private and public IP
- Reserved private IPs:
    * Class A (10.0.0.0/8)
    * Class B (172.16.0.0/12)
    * Class C (192.168.0.0/16)
- Site's border router runs a NAT to allow hosts on private addresses to talk with internet
- NAT maintains mapping between internal and external address/port pairs

### Routing

- Routing packets takes the form of rules (rooutes)
- Routing information is stored in a table in the kernel
- Routing means:
    1. Looking up a network address in the routing table to forward a packet to its destinatioon
    2. Building the routing table in the first place
- `netstat -r` to view routing table
    * Shows a host's network interfaces (e.g., `eth0` and `eth1`)
    * Shows Gateway associated with interfaces and their destination
    * Host can only rouote packets to gateway machines that are reachable throuogh a directly connected network
- `route add` to add a route

### ARP: Address Resolution Protocol

- Hardware addresses needed to transport data across a network's link layer.
- ARP finds hardware address associated with an IP
- If host A wants to send a packet to host B on same network, it uses ARP to find B's hardware address
- If not on same network, host A uses ARP to find router
- ARP is cached on each machine
- ARP works by broadcasting packet asking for hardware address for an IP
    * Corresponding machine replies: yes, that is the IP assigned to one of my interfaces with hardware address
- `arp` examines and manipulates the kernel's ARP cache
    * Useful for debugging e.g., two hosts using same IP

### DHCP: The Dynamic Host Configuratioon Protocol

- When you plug in a device into a network, DHCP is used to:
    * Obtains IP address for itself on local network
    * Sets up appropriate default route
    * Connects itself to a local DNS server
- Protocol lets a DHCP client lease a variery of network parameters from a central server that is authorized to distribute them:
    * IP addresses and netmasks
    * Gateways (default routes)
    * DNS servers
    * Syslog hosts
    * Proxy servers, NTP servers
- Clients report back periodically too DHCP server to renew their leases

### DHCP Software

- Server package is called `dhcp3-server` on Ubuntu
- Recommended to use ISC package over vendor specific implementations

### How DHCP Works

- DHCP client broadcasts "Who am I?" message
- DHCP server negotiates with client to provide an IP address and other networking parameters
- When client's lease time is over, it attempts to renew its lease

### ISC's DHCP Software

- ISC's daemon is called `dhcpd`, config file is in `/etc/dhcpd.conf` or `/etc/dhcp3/dhcpd.conf`
- ISC's DHCP client stores status files in `/var/lib/dhcp`

### Security Issues

- IP forwarding: best to turn off unless server is meant to be a router since packets can be coerced to oseem like they are coming from within the network
- ICMP redirects: can maliciously reroute traffic and tamper with routing tables
- Broadcast pings have been used in DDoS attacks
- IP spoofing: if software creating packet uses raw socket, it can fill in any source address it likes
- VPN establishes a series of secure, encrypted tunnels from various locations

### Basic Network Configuration

- Basic steps to add a new machine to a local network:
    1. Assign it a unique IP and hostname
    2. Make sure network interfaces configured at boot time
    3. Set up default route
    4. Point to a DNS server to allow it access to internet
- Most configuration done on DHCP server
- Use `ping` and `traceroute` to debug

### Hostname and IP address assignment

- Mapping from hostname to IP best maintained through:
    * `hosts` file
    * LDAP
    * DNS
    * Some combination of above options
- `/etc/hosts` oldest and simplest way to map names to IPs
    * Example line: `127.0.0.1 localhost`
- Use DNS or LDAP to find mappings for rest of local network or the world wide web
- `hostname` assigns a hostname to a machine

### ifconfig: configure network interfaces

- `ifconfig` command:
    * Enables or disables a network interface
    * Sets its IP and subnet mask
    * Example: `ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.13 netmask 255.255.255.0 up`
    * Sets IP and netmask for interface eth0 and readies it for use
- `ifconfig -a` lists the system's network interfaces

### route: configure static rouotes

- `route` defines static routes
- Routing performed at the IP layer
- Packet's destination IP is compared with the routes in the kernel's routing table; there are two cases:
    1. Packet destined for some host on a directly connected network; next-hop gateway address in the routing table is that local host's own interface; packet sent directly to that host; this type of route is added to the routing table by `ifconfig`
    2. If no route matches the destination, the default route is invoked; otherwise an ICMP network unreachable message is returned to to the sender
- Example: `route add -net 192.168.45.128/25 zulu-gw.atrust.net`
    * Adds route to the `192.168.45.128/25` network thruogh the gateway rouoter `zulu-gw.atrust.net` which must be an adjacent host or a local host's own interfaces
- Other tips:
    * `netstat -nr` to see existing ruotes
    * Use `default` keyword to set default route
    * `route delete` or `route del` to remove entries of a routing table
    * `route flush` to initialize the routing table
    * `/etc/networks` maps names to network numbers like the `hosts` file for mapping hosotnames to IP addresses
    * `rouote add -host` to set up a route thats specific to a single IP

### DNS configuration

- To configure a machine as a DNS client, set up `/etc/resolv.conf`
    * Lists DNS domains that should be searched to resolve names
    * Should list closest stable DNS servers first
    * DHCP client typically adds addresses into `resolv.conf`

### System-Specific Network Configuration

- Use of `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf` relatively constant among Linux systems

### Linux Networking

- After any change to a file that controls network config at boot, you may need to either reboot or bring network interface down then up again
- Use `ifdown <interface>` and `ifup <interface>`

### Ubuntu Network Configuration

- Ubuntu configures the network in:
    * `/etc/hostname` - sets hostname
    * `/etc/network/interfaces` - sets IP address, netmask and default gateway
- `ifup` and `ifdown` bring up and down the interfaces
