### Chapter 1 - Introduction

The LFS system will be built using an already installed Linux distribution (e.g., Debian). The existing host provides the compiler, linker and shell to build the new system.

Breakdown of this book:
- Chapter 2 will create a new partition and file system where the LFS system will be compiled and installed.
- Chapter 3 explains which packages need to be downloaded to build the LFS system.
- Chapter 4 sets up the working environment.
- Chapter 5 explains installation of packages that form the basic development suite. Some packages are needed to resolve circular dependencies e.g., to compile a compiler. After Chapter 5, LFS no longer depends on the host except for the running kernel.
- Chapter 6 builds the full LFS system. We use `chroot` to start a new shell whose root directory is in the LFS partition. This is similar to rebooting and telling the kernel to mount the LFS partition as the root partition.
- Chapter 7 sets up basic system configurations.
- Chapter 8 creates the kernel and boot loader. After this step, the computer can be rebooted into the new LFS system.
