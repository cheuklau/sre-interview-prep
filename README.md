# SRE Interview Preparation

This repo contains resources for SRE interview preparation. It is divided into two sections:
1. Cramming materials
2. Fundamental materials

The `cramming` directory contains resources that are useful for cramming for SRE/Devops interviews. These resources work well for 75% of the SRE/Devops interviews that you may face. For the other 25% (more selective companies), they require a deeper understanding that requires structured learning of fundamentals.

For example, lets say you are asked to describe the Linux booting process. Several of the resources in `cramming` will give a cursory overview of the steps involved, but if the interviewer starts digging deeper into a particular step, you will be lost without fundamental knowledge of computer architecture and assembly. Similar examples can be provided for other questions regarding application performance, memory management, CPU scheduling, etc. The `fundamentals` directory contains resources that are much more structured (i.e., full courses and textbooks) that provide a solid background to the material in `cramming`.
