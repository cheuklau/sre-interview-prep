    "We start at (0, 0) index, and begin the algorithm by moving up in the x-index to (1, 0), our first move is up and to the right which has a delta of (-1, +1) resulting in (0, 1). At this point we stop our up and to the right movement because we have hit our x lower bound of zero, or we recognize that we have hit the reverse of (1, 0) i.e., (0, 1). Next we move up in the y-index to (0, 2) and start our down and to the left movement which has a delta of (+1, -1). We go to (1, 1) then (2, 0) and stop again due to the previous reasons. Next we move up in x-index to (3, 0) and move up and to the right until we hit (0, 3). When we hit the y-limit, we realize we can no longer increment y so we increment x moving to (1, 3) and move down and to the left until we hit (3, 1). Next we move up in y-index to (3, 2) and move up and to the right to (2, 3) Finally we increase x-index to (3, 3) arriving at the final element. The general strategy is:\n",
    "1. Start at (0, 0)\n",
    "2. Alternate increasing x or y by one each time you move to a new diagonal strip until you hit a limit, at which point increment the other even if it is out of this alternating order\n",
    "3. Alternate deltas (-1, +1) and (+1, -1) for each diagonal strip regardless of what happens in step 2\n",
