# Troubleshoooting

## Effective Troubleshooting (Soure: Google SRE - Chapter 13)

- Steps:
    1. Problem report
        * What is the expected behavior?
        * What is the actual behavior?
        * How to reproduce the behavior?
    2. Triage
        * How to make system work as well as possible?
    3. Examine
        * USE method (next section)
        * Examine each component's behavior.
        * Use system metrics.
        * Use logging, trace requests through the stack.
        * Expose RPC/API endpoints recently sent/received to understand how servers communicate.
    4. Diagnose
        * Develop plausible hypotheses.
        * Look at connections between componenets.
        * Ask what is malfunctioning system doing, why is it doing it, and where are its resouorces being used.
        * Find what touched it last e.g., new version deployed or configuration change.
    5. Test/treat
    6. Cure
- To troubleshoot easier:
    * Build observability.
    * Design well-understood and observable interfaces between components.
- Four golden signals:
    1. Latency: time to service a request
    2. Traffic: demand on system
    3. Errors: explicit (500), implicity (200 with wrong content), policy (slow 200s)
    4. Saturation: how full system is

## The USE Method (Source: http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html)

- For every resource check:
    * Utilization
        + Average time resource was busy servicing work.
        + As percent over time e.g., Disk running at 90% utilization.
    * Saturation
        + Degree to which resource has extra work it can't service.
        + As a queue length e.g., CPUs have an average run queue of four.
    * Errors
        + Count of error events.
        + Scalar counts e.g., network interface had 50 late collisions.
- Notes:
    * Low utilization does not mean no saturation e.g., short bursts.
- Resources:
    * CPUs - sockets, cores, threads
        + Utilization: CPU utilization per-CPU or system-wide average
            - System-wide:
                * `vmstat 1`
                    ```

                + Check for `pgscan`
        + Errors when allocation failed

                    + Check `file-nr`

                + Check for errors on system calls returning file descriptors e.g., `open()`, `accept()` etc
- Suggested Interpretations
    * Utilization
        + 100% is sign of a bottleneck
        + 70%+ can begin to be a problem:
            - If measured over a long time, it can hide short bursts of 100%
            - Some resources e.g., hard disks cannot be interrupted during operation; abovoe 70%, queueing delays can become more frequent and noticeable
    * Saturation
        + Any degree can be a problem
    * Errors
        + Non-zero errors worth investigating especially if they are increasing while performance is poor
- Cloud Computing
    * Software resource controls may limit tenants sharing system
    * Hypervisor or container (cgroup) limits for memory, CPU, network, storage I/O
- Strategy
    1. Start
    2. Identify resources
    3. Choose a resource
    4. Errors? If yes, investigate
    5. High utilization? If yes, investigate
    6. High saturation? If yes, investigate
    7. All resources checked? If no return to 3.

## The TSA Method (Source: http://www.brendangregg.com/tsamethod.html)

- For each thread, measure total time in different thread states.
    * `top -H -p <pid>`
        ```
        top - 07:14:15 up 6 days,  8:17,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
        Threads:   1 total,   0 running,   1 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
        %Cpu(s):  0.0 us,  0.0 sy,  0.0 ni, 99.7 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.3 st
        KiB Mem :  1006948 total,   231052 free,    86732 used,   689164 buff/cache
        KiB Swap:        0 total,        0 free,        0 used.   762792 avail Mem
          PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
           1 root      20   0  125628   5464   3932 S  0.0  0.5   0:27.95 systemd
        ```
        * Executing = `us` + `sy` + `ni`
        * Runnable = `wa`
        * Anonymous paging = `stopped`
        * Sleeping = `sleeping`
        * Lock = `stopped`
        * Idle = `id`
- Investigate states from the most to least frequent with appropriate tools.
- Thread time divided into:
    1. Executing
        * Running on-CPU
        * Split into user and kernel time
        * For user time, `CPU profilers` (e.g., flame graphs) identify hot code paths
        * For system time examine system call rates using `strace` or `dtrace`
    2. Runnable
        * Run queue latency
        * Check system-wide CPU utilization and saturation with `USE`
    3. Anonymous paging (swapping)
        * Runnable but either swapped out or paged out, waiting for residency
        * Check system-wide main memory availability with `USE`
        * Look for paging and swapping memory saturation metrics with `USE`
    4. Sleeping
        * Waiting for I/O including network, blck, data/text page-ins
        * Check system calls (identify time in system calls and related resources; check `mmap()` and non-system call I/O via mappings)
        * Check resource usage to identify busy resources
        * Check thread blocking (see off CPU performance analysis)
        * `iostat`
    5. Lock
        * Waiting to acquire a synchronization lock (waiting for someone else)
        * Identify the lock thread is waiting on and the reason it took time to acquire
    6. Idle
        * Waiting for work
        * Check client load applied
        * Various reasons for idleness e.g., waiting for new network connection, network I/O, a locl, timer; difficult to identify idle state
- Example 1:
    * Application has performance issue. TSA measures thread state time for application threads in each of the six states. 50% time spent runnable, waiting for turn on CPU. USE shows CPU limit reached. Solution is to increase CPU limit.
- Example 2:
    * MySQL is slow. TSA measures thread state time for MySQL. Shows large percentage of time spent runnable, waitind for other applications stealing CPU cycles.
- Document shows how to use `prstat` in Solaris but no Ubuntu/centos equivalent
- Create Flame graph to visualize codepaths consumed CPUs
    * x-axis: stack profile population (wider = more often it was in stacks)
    * y-axis: stack depth
    * Find long running functions
- `perf record -F <sample rate> -p <pid>` Linux profiler
    * Visualize as a Flame graph

## Network Troubleshooting (Source: Chapter 10 Systems Performance)

### Packet Sniffing

- Capture packets from network so protocol headers and data can be inspected.
- Information captured:
    * Timestamp
    * Packet including header (ethernet, IP, TCP), partial or full payload data
    * Metadata including number of packets, drops
- `tcpdump -ni eth0`

### Static Performance Tuning

- Number of network interfaces in use
- Max speed of network interfaces
- Half or full duplex network interfaces
- MTU configured for network interfaces
- Is forwarding enabled?
- Software imposed network throughput limits (important for cloud computing)

### Resource Controls

- Network bandwidth limits for different connections, processes, groups of processes applied by the kernel.
- Priorization of network traffic (IP QoS). Higher priority to traffic between clients and server.

### Analysis

- `netstat` discussed in USE
- `sar` discussed in USE
- `ifconfig` discussed in USE
- `ip` discussed in USE
- `nicstat` discussed in USE
- `ping`
