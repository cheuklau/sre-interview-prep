    "Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. Function should find all triplets in the array that sum up to the target sum and return a two-dimensional array of those triplets. Numbers in each triplet should be ordered in ascending order, and triplets should be ordered with respect to the numbers they hold.\n",

    "Brute force using three for-loops would work but is O(n^3) in time. We could also store all of the integers into a hash table then use a double for-loop with a hash table lookup. This would be O(n^2) in time but require O(n) space. It would also require a bit of work to ensure there are no repeat triplets. \n",

    "### Optimal Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "First sort the array. Iterate through the array once. For each digit, set a left pointer directly right of the integer and a right pointer at the end of the array. We calculate the current sum and if the result is less (resp. greater) than the target sum, we move the left (resp. right) pointer to the right (resp. left). We repeat this until left and right pointers meet. The time complexity is O(n^2), and space complexity is O(n) to store the results."

    "For insertion, we start by comparing the value of the root node to the value we are inserting. If the value is greater than or equal to the root node, we go to the right child. Otherwise, we go to the left child. We repeat this until we reach null then insert the value. For searching, we traverse the BST the same way as insertion until we find the target value. If we reach null then the value does not exist in the BST. For deletion, we traverse the BST until we find the node to delete. If it is a leaf node, we set it to null. For nodes with one child, we set the child of its parent to its child. For nodes with both children, grab the smallest value of the right sub-tree, remove it and use it to replace the node.\n",

    "Given three inputs, all of which are instances of `AncestralTree` class that have an `ancestor` property pointing to their youngest ancestor. First input is top ancestor in the tree and other two are descendents. Write a function that returns the youngest common ancestor to the two descendents.\n",

    "The worst-case scenario is that the LCA is the top ancestor. One way we could approach this problem is to go from each descendent node up to the top, keeping track of all the nodes that they saw along the way. Then perform a comparison between the two routes to find the point of divergence which would be the LCA. However, this would result additional space to store the two paths. We can do this in O(1) space by going from each descendent node to the top ancestor and finding the depth of each node. Then move the lower node up to the same height as the other descendent node. Finally move both nodes in-sync until they meet at the LCA. The time complexity would be O(d) where d is the height of the tree and space complexity is O(1).\n",

    "1. It is full, where the last level is filled out left to right.\n",
    "2. For min-heap, every node in the heap is smaller than or equal than its children nodes' values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The root node is always the smallest value in the heap. You can represent heaps well in the form of an array. The children and parent nodes can be found with some index math. The two children nodes for node $i$ are:\n",

To remove the root of the heap, we pop it then move the last element of the heap to the root node then sift it down (swap with the smallest child) until it is at its proper position. To build the heap, we visit each parent node from bottom to top and sift them down to their proper positions. Both sift down and sift up have a time complexity of O(logn) where n is the number of values in the heap. Build heap is O(n) time. We call sift down on roughly n nodes so we would expect time complexity to be O(nlogn); however nodes near the bottom do not have to be sifted down very far (nearly constant time). Mathematical analysis shows the result is O(n) time.\n",

    "Let's use the example `babc`. We start with an empty dictionary which represents the root of the suffix tree. We look at the the entire substring i.e., `babc` and ask if the first character `b` is a key in the empty dictionary. Since it is not, we add the key `b` pointing to an empty dictionary. We move to the next character `a` and ask if `b` contains an `a` key. Since it does not we add it and we continue until we get to the end of the substring at which point we add `*`. We repeat this for the remaining substrings `abc`, `bc` and `c`. Note that `b` in this case contains two children going to `c*` and `abc*`. For searching we can just ask if the next level contains the next character of the string we are looking for which gives us a time complexity of O(m) where m is the length of the string we are searching for. The time complexity to create the trie is O(n^2) since for each character, we iterate through the rest of the substring."
