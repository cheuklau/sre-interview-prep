    "Set a slow and fast pointer one and two positions ahead of head. For each iteration, move the slow pointer one position ahead and fast pointer two positions ahead. Eventually, they meet meet at some point in the loop, specifically they will meet at the point where the distance before the loop is equal to the distance remaining to complete the loop. Therefore, we reset the slow pointer, and move both the fast and slow pointers one position at a time until they meet. The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).\n",
